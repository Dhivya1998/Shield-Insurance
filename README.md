## Insights

### City-wise Revenue Distribution:
- Delhi NCR and Mumbai are the primary contributors to revenue, especially within the age group 31-40, indicating lucrative markets in these cities.

### Customer Distribution Across Cities:
- Delhi NCR and Mumbai also lead in terms of customer count, underscoring their significance in the customer landscape.

### Customer and Revenue Trends Over Time:
- March 2023 saw a significant surge in both customers and revenue compared to other months, suggesting potential factors driving growth during that period.

### Policy Performance:
- Policies like "POL2005HEL" and "POL3309HEL" stand out in terms of revenue and customer count, respectively, highlighting their effectiveness and popularity among customers.

### Sales Mode Analysis:
- The offline-agent sales mode dominates in both customer count and revenue generation, indicating its effectiveness in attracting and converting customers. However, there's a notable increase in the online-app mode, suggesting growing traction in digital sales channels.

## Recommendations

1. **Focus on Delhi NCR and Mumbai Markets:**
   - Given their significant contribution to revenue and customer count, consider investing more resources and marketing efforts in these cities to capitalize on their potential.

2. **Analyze March 2023 Surge:**
   - Investigate the factors driving the substantial growth observed in March 2023 to identify potential strategies or initiatives that can be replicated in future months.

3. **Optimize Policy Offerings:**
   - Further analyze the performance of top-performing policies to understand their success factors and consider replicating those strategies in other policy offerings to enhance overall performance.

4. **Strategic Sales Mode Allocation:**
   - While the offline-agent mode is performing well, explore ways to bolster the performance of online channels, particularly the online-app mode, to diversify sales channels and capture a broader customer base.

5. **Age Group Targeting:**
   - Given the dominance of the 31-40 age group, tailor marketing strategies and product offerings to better cater to the preferences and needs of this demographic, potentially offering customized policies or incentives to attract and retain customers in this age bracket.
